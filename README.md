# Using R for High-Throughput (Genomic) Analysis

_R_ is a very popular open-source statistical programming language,
with lots of interesting features and challenging quirks. _R_ is used
in many aspects of data analysis, by people ranging from students in
small academic groups to professional engineers in the largest social
media companies. This tutorial takes us from the basics of _R_ to
advanced features that are particularly interesting to scientists and
engineers. We'll talk about 'atomic' vectors, functional and
vectorized computations, _R_'s unique class systems, visualization,
extending _R_ to process large data, and literate programming. A lot
of material for a couple of hours, but it'll be fun.

## About

Dr. Martin Morgan has been working with _R_ for the last 10 years or
so; he currently leads the successful and widely used open-source _R_
/ [Bioconductor][1] project for the analysis and comprehension of high
throughput genomic data. Dr. Morgan grew up in Toronto, earned a PhD
in Ecology and Evolution from the University of Chicago, and gradually
shifted his focus to computational and statistical aspects of
biology. Dr. Morgan recently moved to Buffalo as an associate
professor at Roswell Park Cancer Institute.
